# MLLM-Genesis: A cookbook of building MLLM Step-by-Step

Are you looking for a comprehensive guide on building Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) step-by-step? Look no further! This repository is designed to give you a complete roadmap on how to build MLLMs, including dataset preparation, model architecture, training receipe, and evaluation pipeline. It differs from other survey papers: Relevant design ideas are extracted from various papers and directly present the summarised information from them when discussing each corresponding component.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is divided into several sections, each covering a specific aspect of building MLLMs. Here's a brief overview of each section:

1. [Dataset Preparation](#dataset-preparation)
2. [Model Architecture](#model-architecture)
3. [Training Recipe](#training-recipe)
4. [Evaluation Pipeline](#evaluation-pipeline)

Each section contains a detailed explanation of the corresponding aspect of building MLLMs, including relevant papers, code, and other resources. The repository also includes a glossary of terms and a list of references for further reading.

You can also clone the repository and create the corresponding environment for practical experiments:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MAOJIASONG/MLLMs-from-scratch.git
   cd MLLMs-from-scratch
   conda env create -n mllm_genesis python=3.10
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
